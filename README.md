# 🧠 Daily DSA Patterns in C++

> A structured repository documenting my daily journey of solving **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems — with focus on **underlying patterns**, **optimization**, and **C++ implementations**.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is my ongoing commitment to mastering **algorithmic problem-solving** and building a strong foundation for **systematic coding interviews** and **real-world software challenges**.

Every problem I solve here includes:
- ✅ **Optimized C++ solution**
- 🧩 **Identified underlying pattern / approach**
- 🔍 **Time & Space complexity analysis**
- 💡 **Reasoning / insights gained**

> The focus is not just on *solutions*, but on *pattern recognition* — understanding *why* an algorithm works and *when* to apply it.
